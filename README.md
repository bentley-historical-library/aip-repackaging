# BHL AIP Repackager
Repackages AIPs for the Bentley Historical Library's Archivematica --> DSpace workflow

## Installation
`pip install git+https://github.com/djpillen/aip-repackaging.git`

## Use
This package installs a script, `aip_repacker.py`, that can be used to copy AIPs from Archivematia's AIP Storage into a working directory, split and repackage the AIPs into `metadata.zip` and `objects.zip`, upload the AIPs to DSpace, and update ArchivesSpace with digital objects.

The use of this tool is highly localized to practices at the BHL.
